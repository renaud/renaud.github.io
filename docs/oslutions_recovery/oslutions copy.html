		<p>i can&#8217;t work without debug statements. i mean: LOG.debug that show in the console. currently, we use the (very good) testNG testing framework, but unfortunately i could not manage to make it output any debug statements to the console. on another project using Jetty, we have the same issue&#8230; so, i hacked a maven artifact: <a title="slf4j-simple-debug" href="/web/20100106091038/http://oslutions.com/ren/public/simplelogger-debug.tgz">download</a> and install, then add the following to pom.xml</p>
<p>&lt;dependency&gt;<br />
&lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;<br />
&lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br />
&lt;version&gt;1.5.6&lt;/version&gt;<br />
&lt;/dependency&gt;<br />
&lt;dependency&gt;<br />
&lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;<br />
&lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-simple-debug&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br />
&lt;version&gt;1.5.6&lt;/version&gt;<br />
&lt;/dependency&gt;</p>
<p>tala, now you can LOG.debug() things.</p>

		<p><a title="Apache Sling" href="/web/20100106091038/http://incubator.apache.org/sling/">Sling</a> is a web framework that uses a <a title="JCR" href="/web/20100106091038/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java">Java Content Repository</a> (JCR) to store and manage content. Sling is a project of the <a title="Apache" href="/web/20100106091038/http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> (currently in the Incubator). As <a title="Lars Trieloff" href="/web/20100106091038/http://weblogs.goshaky.com/weblogs/lars/entry/what_is_sling">Lars</a> puts it, &#8220;the main role of Sling is being a translator between the JCR repository and the client application.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with it for the last couple of days, and Sling is the coolest thing since I tried Ruby on Rails! Bye bye XML configurexageration and endless boilerplate code. Sling comes with the very handy <a href="/web/20100106091038/http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/cheatsheet.html">SlingPostServlet</a> that lets you do almost everything.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s the point?</h4>
<p>Sling lets you drive your content repository from within a webpage by making an ajax request with jQuery. And it&#8217;s easy.</p>
<h4>How do we get started?</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s an excellent <a title="Sling 15 minutes tutorial" href="/web/20100106091038/http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/discover-sling-in-15-minutes.html">&#8220;15 minutes&#8221; Sling tutorial</a> to get you started. For the example below, I used <a title="Day CRX" href="/web/20100106091038/http://day.com/site/en/index/company/press_center/press_releases/day_software_unveils.html">Day&#8217;s new CRX</a>, a packaged and enhanced version of the Sling framework. You should definitively check it out, <a title="Day Cup 08" href="/web/20100106091038/http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/cup.c.html">even if you don&#8217;t need a new computer&#8230; </a></p>
<ul>
<li>first, <a href="/web/20100106091038/http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/cup/downloads.c.html">download</a> and install CRX</li>
<li>then start the server (on *nix: cd server, ./start) and check the welcome page: http://localhost:7402</li>
<li>mount the jcr repository on your Desktop with <a href="/web/20100106091038/http://localhost:7402/content/crx/docs/webdav.html">WebDAV</a></li>
<li>now create your sample application: from your WebDAV drive, create a folder &#8220;helloJquery&#8221; inside &#8220;apps&#8221;</li>
<li>download <a href="/web/20100106091038/http://code.google.com/p/jqueryjs/downloads/detail?name=jquery-1.2.6.js">jQuery</a> and copy it in your &#8220;helloJquery&#8221; folder</li>
<li>donwload <a href="/web/20100106091038/http://oslutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hellojqueryhtml.zip">this file</a> and copy it in your &#8220;helloJquery&#8221; folder</li>
<li>open your browser at <a href="/web/20100106091038/http://localhost:7402/apps/helloJquery/helloJquery.html">http://localhost:7402/apps/helloJquery/helloJquery.html</a>. the next steps are there&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h4>What just happened?</h4>
<p>We used jQuery to create a node named &#8220;mynode&#8221; below &#8220;content&#8221;, with a property &#8220;oneProperty&#8221; and value &#8220;oneValue&#8221;.</p>
<p><code>$.post(<br />
"/content/*",<br />
{ ':nameHint': 'myName', oneProperty: 'oneValue' },<br />
function(data){ alert(data); }<br />
);</code></p>
<p>If you are not familiar with jQuery, the code might look cryptic, but in 2 words: $.post creates the ajax post request, taking 3 parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;/content/*&#8221; as url, using SlingPostServlet to create a new jcr node under the /content node</li>
<li>{ &#8216;:nameHint&#8217;: &#8220;mynode&#8221;, oneProperty: &#8216;oneValue&#8217; } is a key:pair list of request parameters. &#8216;:nameHint&#8217; is a command (starts with &#8216;:&#8217;) that tells Sling to use &#8220;mynode&#8221; for the node name. oneProperty: sets one property under mynode</li>
<li>the third (optional) parameter is a callback</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s the ajax equivalent of using this html form:</p>
<pre>
&lt;form action="/content/*" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name=":nameHint"   value=""myName"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text"   name="oneProperty" value="oneValue"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

		<p>i have been volunteering now for 2 weeks at the <a href="/web/20100106091038/http://www.iimcmissioncal.org/">Institute for Indian Mother and Child</a> (IIMC) in Kolkata, and really enjoy it. IIMC is an NGO that provides medical care, education and micro credit to villages south of Kolkata.<br />
i spend my time between building a contact management system for them (which they are really excited about) and teaching computer to kids. we have 4 computers at the moment, and are busy practicing typing, paint (beginners), and Word/Powerpoint (more advanced student).  yesterday, a girl came for the first time — she had never used a computer. i  showed her how to move the mouse, and it was a quite magic moment when she started to understand that it moved on the screen also. stuff we take for granted. i guess i learn as much as they do (if not more), but in any case we are having a great time together.</p>

	<div class="cite">Saturday March 01st 2008, 8:09 am </div>

		<p>approximately 40 per cent of Indians lack access to formal financial services. the biggest barrier is cost of penetration. last week, i met with Shan Shank Chowdhury, VP at A.Little.World, a mobile software business in Mumbai who has developped a microbanking platform called &#8220;ZERO&#8221;.</p>
<p>the platform relies on Custom Service Providers (CST) in remote villages to deliver financial services. a CST is a local entrepreneur who uses a cell phone, combined with a RFID reader and a fingerprint. local bank customers show their bank card, which includes biometrical datas (picture and fingerprint). the CST verifies the identity of the customer, and performs the transaction via mobile phone.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="pic" id="image77" src="/web/20100106091038im_/http://oslutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tran1.jpg" /></div>
<p>a typical case in rural India: a woman buy and sells vegetables during the day at the town market. when she comes home in the evening, her man takes the money for drinking. ZERO lets her deposit the money right when she leaves the market, and pick it up again the next day.</p>
<p>the complexity of the system is humongous: 14 states in India, 16 banks, 200 villages (1000 planned for June 08)&#8230; the only negative point i see so far is that only large banks are involved, not small local ones.</p>
<p>ZERO will also be active in the national remittance markets, by dramatically shortening the time it takes for money to reach the beneficiary (currently 7 to 10 days) and lower the cost of the transaction to 1/10th of the current cost. there are currently 2 pilots in Dehli and Bihar.</p>

		<p>I got a chance yesterday to visit the <a title="OLPC" href="/web/20100106091038/http://oslutions.com/blog/www.laptop.org">OLPC</a> (one laptop per child) <a title="Khairat Chronicle" href="/web/20100106091038/http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Khairat_Chronicle">pilot in Khairat</a>, a rural village close to Mumbai. The pilot started last October with 20 XO laptops.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img id="image76" alt="khairat" src="/web/20100106091038im_/http://oslutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Khairat+classroom+activity+2.jpg" /></div>

<p>It was great to see the students playing/working with their laptops: they impressed me by how confident/comfortable they were with their laptops. The teacher is incredibly dedicated to the project and the kids. He demoed us a shared chat, where he would ask problems (like 2+2=?) and the students sharing the chat session could cast their answers. All this over mesh networking, with a dead-simple way to create/join a session. One girl showed me proudly her Etoys project (drawing shapes, connections, text, animations, simple scripting), and we managed to find out how to animate the objects, which they (and I) found very cool.</p>
<p>I felt they were very comfortable with the interface (Sugar). The biggest shortcoming at the moment is that it is not yet localized in their own language (Marathi), so text-only commands/menus are quite hard for them, since they don&#8217;t know much English yet. Still, they are trying all possible menus, and share their discoveries with their mates. And anyway, the software will <a title="localization OLPC" href="/web/20100106091038/http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Localization">soon be localized</a>. The team is also looking into alternative energy sources (solar, human powered generator) to deal with frequent power cuts.</p>
<p>Kudos to the OLPC and <a title="Reliance OLPC" href="/web/20100106091038/http://www.rcom.co.in/webapp/Communications/rcom/Media/pdf/RComm_makes_education_OLPC_project.pdf">Reliance</a> teams for this great pilot, which will soon be followed with more pilots all over India. Also, thanks to <a title="OLPC" href="/web/20100106091038/http://web.media.mit.edu/~carlagm/">Carla</a> and <a title="Venkatesh open source" href="/web/20100106091038/http://osindia.blogspot.com/2008/01/as-2007-was-drawing-to-close-i-got.html">Venkatesh</a> for connecting me with the team.</p>

		<p>today at the Indian embassy in Bangkok, i met this desperate US guy that was short on 2200 bahts (~$67) to get his visa for India, so i lent him the money. then followed a nice conversation, and after chatting about the elections, i said: &#8220;you know what would make me more happy than you paying me back, is if you would donate the money to Obama&#8221; (note: non-US citizens cannot officialy donate for US campaigns). the guy took a few secs to think, then said he didn&#8217;t think Obama needed more money, but that he would do it if i wanted it.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t know all that much about Obama and his program, but for me a major strength is that &#8220;<a title="Newsweek" href="/web/20100106091038/http://www.newsweek.com/id/78157/output/print">[he] knows what it means not to be an American&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Update from the NYT (June 11th 08):</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Democrats’ nomination of Obama as their candidate for president has done more to improve America’s image abroad — an image dented by the Iraq war, President Bush’s invocation of a post-9/11 “crusade,” Abu Ghraib, Guantánamo Bay and the xenophobic opposition to Dubai Ports World managing U.S. harbors — than the entire Bush public diplomacy effort for seven years.&#8221;</p>

<p>i have been traveling with my Asus eee for now one month (i missed the opportunity to get an OLPC laptop), and i must say i really like it. it&#8217;s very compact, quite fast, extremely stable, has a good wifi, can run Skype, and is quite cheap (~350$).</p>
<p>just like it is very common nowadays to travel with a memory stick, in the future i can imagine that people might travel with a mini-laptop. this is very convenient, especially as wifi becomes more and more available.</p>

		<p>here comes <a href="/web/20080724231626/http://oslutions.com/coogle/releases/coogle-1.0.xpi">coogle</a>, a simple tiny extension for <a href="/web/20080724231626/http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox</a>. that&#8217;s how it works:<br />
- go to google<br />
- search for oslutions<br />
- click on the first result <img src='/web/20080724231626im_/http://oslutions.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> <br />
- the words &#8220;oslutions&#8221; are highlighted in yellow<br />
- click reload to see the page normally</p>
<p>a nice way for me to get started into writing extension. already workin on the next one, a mail archiver for thunderbird&#8230;</p>

		<p><a href="/web/20080724231626/http://dict.leo.org/">leo</a> is my favourite online translator. the layout is cranky, but search results are very good. and what i also like about it, is that whenever i come back to the page, the form entry has always the focus, and i can start typing my next search straight away. so, no need to click first on the search field&#8230; no rocket science here, it is just a tiny javascript function that does the trick. then i was wondering why other <a href="/web/20080724231626/http://www.google.com/">popular</a> <a href="/web/20080724231626/http://www.yahoo.com/">search</a> <a href="/web/20080724231626/http://www.msn.com/">engines</a> were not offering this? it doesn&#8217;t make sense. why do we have to always use our mouse to make a new search? or maybe it does make sense!? maybe we might click on some other link then. maybe even on an ad. am i seeing evil?</p>
<p>anyway, you don&#8217;t really need your mouse: just typing control-k will bring you to the search bar (but who is willing to use these geeky shortcuts <img src='/web/20080724231626im_/http://oslutions.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />

		<p>i&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="/web/20080724231545/http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/">selenium</a> those last days. a really nice open source functional testing framework(<a href="/web/20080724231545/http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/demo1/TestRunner.html">demo</a>)! what i like about it, is that the tests are very simple to write. actually, it&#8217;s only <a href="/web/20080724231545/http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/testrunner.html">plain html tables</a>. besides, you can follow and see the tests, as the browser-bot executes them.<br />
i need our business people to be able to write tests (i&#8217;ve given up the hope to see programmers write tests. maybe business people will&#8230;). and since i don&#8217;t expect them to know the the element-id they are testing, i wrote some <a href="/web/20080724231545/http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/seleniumReference.html#extending-selenium">extension</a> to selenium.<br />
now you can use &#8220;field=caption&#8221; to locate a field on a page, and enter the text that describes the field. also, &#8220;button=Login&#8221; lets you click on a button labeled &#8220;Login&#8221;.</p>

		<p>wanna know wether water flows downhill or uphill? just ask google, like Peter Norvic (director of search quality at google) <a href="/web/20080724231714/http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P7480_0_3_0_C">says</a>.<br />
it&#8217;s that easy: just type &#8220;water flows downhill&#8221; (make sure to put quote marks around it, <a href="/web/20080724231714/http://www.google.com/help/basics.html#phrases">here</a> is why). i got around 5,200 hits. then try with &#8220;water flows uphill&#8221;, which gave me 1400 hints. see: google&#8217;s right!

		<p>i&#8217;m diving into rdf and ontologies. seems very promising, but i feel alot of hype there. i liked the conclusion of Cory, about google&#8217;s use of links between webpages:<br />
&#8220;observational metadata is far more reliable than the stuff that human beings create for the purposes of having their documents found&#8221; Cory Doctorow, <a title="Metacrap" href="/web/20080724231714/http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm">metacrap</a><br />
i believe this is exactly what the semantic web should try to achieve: semantic applications should exploit the semantics that people <em>already </em>produce.

		<p>&#8220;The dream behind the Web is of a common information space in which we communicate by sharing information. Its universality is essential: the fact that a hypertext link can point to anything, be it personal, local or global, be it draft or highly polished. There was a second part of the dream, too, dependent on the Web being so generally used that it became a realistic mirror (or in fact the primary embodiment) of the ways in which we work and play and socialize. That was that once the state of our interactions was on line, we could then use computers to help us analyse it, make sense of what we are doing, where we individually fit in, and how we can better work together.&#8221; <a title="Tim Berners-Lee: A short history of web development" href="/web/20080724231810/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ShortHistory.html">Tim Berners-Lee: A short history of web development</a>

		<p>approximately 40 per cent of Indians lack access to formal financial services. the biggest barrier is cost of penetration. last week, i met with Shan Shank Chowdhury, VP at A.Little.World, a mobile software business in Mumbai who has developped a microbanking platform called &#8220;ZERO&#8221;.</p>
<p>the platform relies on Custom Service Providers (CST) in remote villages to deliver financial services. a CST is a local entrepreneur who uses a cell phone, combined with a RFID reader and a fingerprint. local bank customers show their bank card, which includes biometrical datas (picture and fingerprint). the CST verifies the identity of the customer, and performs the transaction via mobile phone.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="pic" id="image77" src="/web/20080724231605im_/http://oslutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tran1.jpg" /></div>
<p>a typical case in rural India: a woman buy and sells vegetables during the day at the town market. when she comes home in the evening, her man takes the money for drinking. ZERO lets her deposit the money right when she leaves the market, and pick it up again the next day.</p>
<p>the complexity of the system is humongous: 14 states in India, 16 banks, 200 villages (1000 planned for June 08)&#8230; the only negative point i see so far is that only large banks are involved, not small local ones.</p>
<p>ZERO will also be active in the national remittance markets, by dramatically shortening the time it takes for money to reach the beneficiary (currently 7 to 10 days) and lower the cost of the transaction to 1/10th of the current cost. there are currently 2 pilots in Dehli and Bihar.

		<p>I got a chance yesterday to visit the <a title="OLPC" href="/web/20080724231338/http://oslutions.com/blog/www.laptop.org">OLPC</a> (one laptop per child) <a title="Khairat Chronicle" href="/web/20080724231338/http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Khairat_Chronicle">pilot in Khairat</a>, a rural village close to Mumbai. The pilot started last October with 20 XO laptops.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img id="image76" alt="khairat" src="/web/20080724231338im_/http://oslutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Khairat+classroom+activity+2.jpg" /></div>
<div style="text-align: center">photo courtesy of <a title="Parimala NIIT" href="/web/20080724231338/http://niit-crcs.blogspot.com/2008/03/i-had-informational-visit-with-assorted.html">Parimala</a></div>
<p>It was great to see the students playing/working with their laptops: they impressed me by how confident/comfortable they were with their laptops. The teacher is incredibly dedicated to the project and the kids. He demoed us a shared chat, where he would ask problems (like 2+2=?) and the students sharing the chat session could cast their answers. All this over mesh networking, with a dead-simple way to create/join a session. One girl showed me proudly her Etoys project (drawing shapes, connections, text, animations, simple scripting), and we managed to find out how to animate the objects, which they (and I) found very cool.</p>
<p>I felt they were very comfortable with the interface (Sugar). The biggest shortcoming at the moment is that it is not yet localized in their own language (Marathi), so text-only commands/menus are quite hard for them, since they don&#8217;t know much English yet. Still, they are trying all possible menus, and share their discoveries with their mates. And anyway, the software will <a title="localization OLPC" href="/web/20080724231338/http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Localization">soon be localized</a>. The team is also looking into alternative energy sources (solar, human powered generator) to deal with frequent power cuts.</p>
<p>Kudos to the OLPC and <a title="Reliance OLPC" href="/web/20080724231338/http://www.rcom.co.in/webapp/Communications/rcom/Media/pdf/RComm_makes_education_OLPC_project.pdf">Reliance</a> teams for this great pilot, which will soon be followed with more pilots all over India. Also, thanks to <a title="OLPC" href="/web/20080724231338/http://web.media.mit.edu/~carlagm/">Carla</a> and <a title="Venkatesh open source" href="/web/20080724231338/http://osindia.blogspot.com/2008/01/as-2007-was-drawing-to-close-i-got.html">Venkatesh</a> for connecting me with the team.

		<p>today at the Indian embassy in Bangkok, i met this desperate US guy that was short on 2200 bahts (~$67) to get his visa for India, so i lent him the money. then followed a nice conversation, and after chatting about the elections, i said: &#8220;you know what would make me more happy than you paying me back, is if you would donate the money to Obama&#8221; (note: non-US citizens cannot officialy donate for US campaigns). the guy took a few secs to think, then said he didn&#8217;t think Obama needed more money, but that he would do it if i wanted it.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t know all that much about Obama and his program, but for me a major strength is that &#8220;<a title="Newsweek" href="/web/20080724231338/http://www.newsweek.com/id/78157/output/print">[he] knows what it means not to be an American&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Update from the NYT (June 11th 08):</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Democrats’ nomination of Obama as their candidate for president has done more to improve America’s image abroad — an image dented by the Iraq war, President Bush’s invocation of a post-9/11 “crusade,” Abu Ghraib, Guantánamo Bay and the xenophobic opposition to Dubai Ports World managing U.S. harbors — than the entire Bush public diplomacy effort for seven years.&#8221;

		<p>Acer just <a title="FT" href="/web/20080724231338/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f2cf731a-daa1-11dc-9bb9-0000779fd2ac.html">announced</a> that they would develop a low-price sub-laptop. some might see it as a competitor to the <a title="OLPC" href="/web/20080724231338/http://laptop.org/">OLPC</a> laptop. i prefer to argue that the OLPC laptop is such a good concept that other companies (like <a title="classmate pc" href="/web/20080724231338/http://www.classmatepc.com/">Intel</a>, <a title="Asus eee" href="/web/20080724231338/http://eeepc.asus.com/">Asus</a>, and now Acer) are now doing the same.</p>
<p>i have been traveling with my Asus eee for now one month (i missed the opportunity to get an OLPC laptop), and i must say i really like it. it&#8217;s very compact, quite fast, extremely stable, has a good wifi, can run Skype, and is quite cheap (~350$).</p>
<p>just like it is very common nowadays to travel with a memory stick, in the future i can imagine that people might travel with a mini-laptop. this is very convenient, especially as wifi becomes more and more available.

		<p>it&#8217;s now been 4 months that i travel through Southeast Asia. i stayed mostly in rural areas, or small cities. so many faces, so many smiles&#8230; people always starting a conversation &#8212; sometimes in the hope of making a few ruppes, sometimes just to share a smile, or talk about our different ways of living. in very remote areas, i always wonder how long it will take for them to be online. it will probably happen much faster than it took/will take them to get electricity, phones. it&#8217;s actually already happening big time&#8230; and i think i want to be part of that. not sure how, and where, but it seems to me that the internet can be a good tool for development. to facilitate the clash of our civilizations.

		<p>have i told you how much i like <a title="pandora" target="_blank" href="/web/20080724231418/http://www.pandora.com/">pandora?</a> it&#8217;s a great project, but they seem to be trapped in their stand-alone player: no standalone client, no api, &#8230;<br />
and no interaction with <a title="itunes" href="/web/20080724231418/http://www.apple.com/itunes/">itunes</a>: how great would that be if you could have pandora create a playlist for you based on the songs you listen on your ipod? well, they better hurry up, because other projects are starting to pop up, like <a title="soundflavor dj" href="/web/20080724231418/http://www.soundflavor.com/">soundflavor dj</a> and <a title="tangerine" href="/web/20080724231418/http://www.potionfactory.com/blog/2006/10/18/introducing-tangerine/">tangerine</a><br />
on the technical side, there seems to be a <a href="/web/20080724231418/http://developer.apple.com/sdk/">sdk from apple</a> or one can <a href="/web/20080724231418/http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/11/03/itunes.html">hack the itunes database directly</a>
